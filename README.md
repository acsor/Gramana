# Gramana

Gramana (Gram-an-a, a play on words from An-a-gram) is an Android application created by a developer trying to brush up his Android knowledge.
Currently, you can permute up to seven tokens and import dictionary files to use for filtering permutation words.
Any dictionary can be imported, with the rule that, of any line, only the starting characters which are not special characters (e.g. ?, !, #, /, %, Â° etc.) are included in the internal clean dictionary.

Below is a very scarce list of dictionaries you can find online.
